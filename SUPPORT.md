# 💖 Support My Open-Source Work

Hi! I'm **Jiri (Jirka) Borovec** — a Machine Learning researcher, open-source maintainer, and consultant with a Ph.D. in Medical Imaging.

Over the years I've contributed thousands of commits to projects like **PyTorch Lightning**, **TorchMetrics**, **Supervision**, and many others. I believe great software should be open, well-tested, and accessible to everyone.
